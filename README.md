## Problem Statement
The insurgency in North-Eastern Nigeria has destroyed educational infrastructure. 

The destruction of educational infrastructure in North-Eastern Nigeria leaves 2.8 million children without access to quality education, trapping them in cycles of poverty and hindering regional development. Rebuilding schools is essential for providing safe learning environments and unlocking these children's potential for a better future.
